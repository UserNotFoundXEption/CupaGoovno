CupaGoovno is a Cuphead mod providing some major changes to the game, increasing its difficulty level in a more creative way than just increasing bosses health and speed in a slightly different way. Currently it's still in development and only demo version is available. Version v1.0 with base game content (no DLC island) will be ready no sooner than in September.

## Demo
- Demo changes 2 bosses: The Root Pack (Vegetables) and Goopy Le Grande (Blue Slime).
- It has 2 versions: The first one is based on my ideas only and the second one includes changes based on my friend's feedback.
- All content is subject to change but the 2 bosses should be basically the same in v1.0.

## Key notes
- **Smoke Bomb charm** no longer works. Instead, choosing this charm activates "Practise Mode", giving you 9 health point at the start of the battle and multiplying damage you deal by 5.
- **Chalice** deals 25% less damage.
- **Difficulty selection screen** allows you to choose only 1 difficulty level.

## Known Issues
- Launching Cuphead in language other than English or changing the laungage mid-game will break difficulty selection screen. You'll see default difficulty modes names and be stuck on "normal". This bug is purely visual. All bosses launch in "hard" difficulty mode.
- Cagney Carnation (Flower boss) uses only 1 attack. It will be fixed in full version.

## Installation
- Use newest Cuphead version
